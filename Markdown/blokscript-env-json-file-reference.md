## `verbosity`

Tells how loud or quiet BlokScript should be.  Valid values are `verbose` and `quiet`.

### `verbose`

Blokscript will tell you what it's doing and report all errors to the terminal.  Good for interactive use.


### `quiet`

Blokscript will not tell you what it's doing, but it will report errors.  Good for scripting or when you only want to know when an error has occurred.
